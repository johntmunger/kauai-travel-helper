# Database Backups

This directory contains backup copies of the kauai.db database file.

Backups are automatically created by:
- `npm run sync:live` - Before syncing from production
- `npm run db:restore` - Before restoring a backup (safety backup)

## Backup Naming

Backups are named with timestamps:
```
kauai-backup-[unix-timestamp].db
pre-restore-[unix-timestamp].db
```

## Managing Backups

To list backups:
```bash
npm run db:list-backups
```

To restore a backup:
```bash
npm run db:restore [backup-filename]
```

## Cleanup

Old backups can be safely deleted to save disk space.
It's recommended to keep at least 1-2 recent backups.

See `backend/scripts/README.md` for more information.
